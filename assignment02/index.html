                    BERLIN — A Vincent van Gogh painting was stolen early Monday from a small museum in Laren in the Netherlands, just 20 miles southeast of Amsterdam, on what would have been the artist’s 167th birthday.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “I feel enormous anger and sadness,” Jan Rudolph de Lorm, the museum’s director, said in a telephone interview. “Because especially in these dark days that we are in, I feel so strongly that art is here to comfort us, to inspire us and to heal us.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    The police were called to the museum at 3:15 a.m., when an alarm went off. By the time they got there, the thief or thieves were already gone, said a spokeswoman for the Dutch police.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All the police found was a shattered glass door and a bare spot on the wall where the painting was displayed. Hours later, the authorities announced that the work, “The Parsonage Garden at Nuenen in Spring,” was taken.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The heist comes as museums in much of Europe and the United States are closed in attempts to stem the spread of the coronavirus. It also comes eight years after a spectacular breach at a museum in Rotterdam, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/17/world/europe/Picasso-and-Monets-Are-Stolen-From-Dutch-Museum.html">where thieves made off with seven paintings</a> valued at more than 100 million euros by forcing an emergency exit, exposing the relatively weak security systems at some art museums.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Coronavirus or not, guards are not usually posted at the museum overnight. The alarm system is linked straight to the local police.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “They knew what they were doing, going straight for the famous master,” Mr. de Lorm said. The police agreed that it would have taken minutes from the time of forced entry to leaving the premises.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The painting was on loan from the Groninger Museum for a special exhibition, “<a target="_blank" href="https://www.singerlaren.nl/en/agenda/440/Exhibition_from_January_14th_until_May_10th_2020/Mirror_of_the_Soul_Toorop_tot_Mondriaan/">Mirror of the Soul</a>,” which was to run from January to May. “It’s an early picture, before Arles and before Paris, so it is darker and less recognizable as a van Gogh,” said Andreas Blühm, the director of the Groninger.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Because of the coronavirus outbreak, museums in the Netherlands closed on March 13, and the Singer Laren had announced that it would be closed until at least June 1.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “It was a very successful exhibition, attracting over 5,000 visitors a week; that is a lot of us,” Mr. de Lorm said.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The picture was painted in 1884 when van Gogh, then 30, moved back in with his parents, who, according to Mr. Blühm, were unconvinced of his career as an artist.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “It is one of our main works of art,” Mr. Blühm said, noting he hoped it would be found. “But every piece of art that is stolen from a public museum is art that is stolen from society.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    A <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/01/arts/international/van-gogh-paintings-recovered.html?searchResultPosition=2">couple of van Gogh paintings</a> that were stolen <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2002/12/08/world/two-van-gogh-works-are-stolen-in-amsterdam.html">from a museum in Amsterdam 18 years</a> ago resurfaced four years ago.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Asked whether the artist’s birthday figured in the heist, Mr. de Lorm said the thieves probably did not know.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “It’s just strange coincidence, synchronicity — that sometimes happens in life,” he said.

                    The organisers of the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theartnewspaper.com/preview/rare-loans-bolster-biggest-ever-jan-van-eyck-show">largest ever exhibition dedicated to the Flemish Old Master Jan Van Eyck</a>, held at the Museum of Fine Arts Ghent, aim to refund 144,000 ticket holders unable to see the show which closed early due to the coronavirus outbreak. The costs may be met through an insurance payout which could total more than €3.5m (the charge for a full-price ticket was €25). <em>Van Eyck: an Optical Revolution</em> opened 1 February and was due to run until 30 April, but closed 13 March. The organisers are "currently in talks with their insurer", says a museum spokesman.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Due to the recent extension of the [coronavirus] measures until 3 May, it is now also no longer possible to reopen the exhibition. The museum had taken out cancellation insurance for the exhibition and is currently working on the practical organisation of a refund of the tickets, in consultation with the insurer. We hope to contact you soon with more details,” say the organisers in an email sent to ticketholders on 23 April. A virtual tour of the show can still be accessed on <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IZxr6eGJqk&feature=emb_logo">YouTube</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The show brought together around half of the 20 to 22 autograph works in existence, with several remarkable international loans. Sections of the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theartnewspaper.com/news/facelift-for-the-mystic-lamb"><em>Ghent Altarpiece</em></a> (1432, also called <em>Adoration of the Mystic Lamb</em>)—the masterpiece that Van Eyck created with his brother Hubert—were also on loan from Ghent’s Saint Bavo’s Cathedral. The Ghent City Alderman responsible for culture, Sami Souguir, told the Belgian news service <em>Vrt Nws</em> however that when the museum contacted the 73 lenders to ask if loans could be extended, "most didn't respond". The museum declined to comment further.

                    Aldo Sebastián Cicchini is a violinist from the Radiotelevisione Italiana (RAI) orchestra in Milan, Italy.  When the COVID-19 pandemic hit in Italy, he was involved in a project at La Scala, one of the most historic opera houses in Italy. But, as he explains, work ended after positive cases of the virus were confirmed there in late February.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Everyone stopped: opera, cinema, theatre…everything. We are all worried about this, because it's difficult to think about our work as it was before. Right now, it’s so hard to imagine going to a concert in a theatre filled with 1000 people! So, we are concerned that, once the lockdown is over, it will take several months to re-adjust, and life may never be exactly as it was before.
                </p>
                <h5>
                    Balcony concerts
                </h5>
                <p>
                    In March, one of my colleagues in the orchestra at La Scala called on every musician in Italy to open their window, or to go to the balcony, to perform at six in the afternoon.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The first time I took part it was a very cold evening. It was strange, because most of the neighbours didn't know that I played violin! When I started playing, I felt quite shy, but after a couple of minutes, I could see people happy, and smiling. Then, after I had finished the piece, they were clapping, shouting, and demanding more! I carried on playing, and they wanted more and more, so I told them, if you want this, let's do it again tomorrow, at the same time. That was the beginning of everything.
                </p>
                <p>
                    From then on, I played many famous pieces from different countries, such as music from the movie “Cinema Paradiso”, “Claire de Lune” by Debussy, Carlos Gardel’s “Por Una Cabeza”, and “Imagine” by John Lennon. Although the acoustics are not great on the balcony, the music is bringing people closer together during this time of isolation. It is not a cure for the disease, but it is maybe a cure for our hearts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I think that, in times like this, all the arts are very, very important. Right now, we need to survive, but surviving is not living. The beauty of art makes us united, and part of something that is bigger than us.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here in my building, every time I played, despite the distance between us, we felt closer. It's feels like we are a team, going forward together. And that's the power of music. And, when I play, I am company to people who live alone, particularly older people.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We still don’t know when the city, and the country, will reopen, but I hope that every day things will get better, and that the people don’t give up. Until then, I will continue to play for them."
